The Gospel Youth had quite the first year, releasing their self-produced 'Kids' EP in November 2014, being chosen as main support for Deaf Havana, to playing Breakout Festival.

Their second EP 'Empires' followed in July 2015, a 5 track salvo of pure uplifting pop-rock goodness.

After sharing the stage with the likes of Mallory Knox, We Are The Ocean and the now disbanded Verses, along with an acoustic set at Hevy Fest, the momentum built shows no sign of slowing down in 2016.

## What's Next?

The band have a big announcement coming on the 15/2/16, and have just released info about a small run of shows in March.

Catch them at Sticky Mikes Frog bar with Vukovi & Bad Girl Island on the 16th March 2016.

For fans of - Deaf Havana, The Gaslight Anthem.
