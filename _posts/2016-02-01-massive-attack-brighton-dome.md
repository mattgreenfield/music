#Massive Attack – Brighton Dome – 01/02/2016

##The Show

Massive Attack came to the Brighton Dome on the back of their first new material in 6 years. Tickets for the show sold out pretty much straight away, so demand and expectation for the show was high. They didn’t disappoint.
Ritual Spirit is their new EP which was released on January 28th 2016, and features collaborations with acts such as Azekel, Roots Manuva and Young Fathers, with the latter happening to be their support act for the evening. Young Fathers need no introduction to the Brighton music scene, having played in Brighton a few times now and also winners of the Mercury prize in 2014, which threw them into the limelight of the UK music scene and throughout the world. They were the perfect warm up act on the evening, offering a unique performance, which fitted the surroundings of the Brighton Dome. They were appreciated well by the crowd and started the evening off with a special tone. If you are not too familiar with Young Fathers material, check out a few of their songs on their Youtube channel here: [https://www.youtube.com/user/YOUNGFATHERS]( https://www.youtube.com/user/YOUNGFATHERS).

Massive Attack graced the stage at roughly 9pm, with their light show on par with their music. Kicking off with Battle Box 001, the force of Massive Attack’s power hit through the audience from the offset. They played through their back catalogue, with songs off 1998’s ‘Mezzanine’ drawing the greatest response from the sold out crowd. The whole of the hour and 45 minute set, went by in a flash, simply because this is an act that have been owning stages for almost 3 decades now, they know how to please a crowd. The new material was also well received, playing 3 songs from their Ritual Spirit EP. With Young Fathers in support, it seemed logical for a cameo appearance from the band on track ‘Voodoo In My Blood’ which was played during the 4 song encore at the end of the show. During the set, a stripped down version of ‘Teardrop’ was played and straight into a heavy ‘Angel’.  This showed again how Massive Attack know how to put a setlist together, as it felt like every song seamlessly flowed together. Being the first time that I had seen Massive Attack (No idea why it has taken so long, having been a fan of the band for years since my parents introduced me to them) I was in complete awe of their performance. Saying to a friend, that some acts ‘Just get it’ when it comes to performances. The stage show was perfect too, accompanying to the theme of each song. They completely met the demand and expectation of the crowd, I for one can’t wait to seem them again. I Can imagine they would be perfect to see in a festival surrounding? Anyone that has experiences of them at a festival, let us know.

##What’s Next

They are due to release a second EP in Spring (2016) with an album due to arrive later this year. They are also playing several festival dates in the UK and Europe this year. If you get the chance to see them, definitely take up the offer. If you already have seen them, you know that you will want to again. I will be.
