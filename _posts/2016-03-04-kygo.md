#Kygo - Artist Feature

I have been listening to Kygo’s music for over two years now, right back to when he was producing remix’s of hits, such as “Sexual Healing” by Marvin Gaye and Ed Sheeran’s “I see Fire”, at this time he was creating quite the stir on Youtube and Soundcloud racking up millions upon millions of listens. Being a massive fan of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) I am always searching for new producers and music to feed my raver buzz, but when I came across Kygo his music gave me a totally different feeling. By turning the tempo to slower than normal EDM tracks and adding beautiful piano melodies Kygo seems to have created a entirely new genre of EDM music with fans and critics say it is ‘Tropical House’, and respectively I agree. It is music that doesn't make me want me to go crazy flapping my arms furiously in the air, but music that I could see myself listening to calmly on a beach. He has created a very feel good and happy dance vibe.

From remix’s to his own music, Kygo had a massive 2015. Releasing his first single ‘Firestone’ in early December 2014, it proved to be a big start to his professional career as it made it into the UK top 10, selling over 600,000. The hype wasn’t going to end there as in March 2015 he released his second single “Stole the show” which also sold hugely earning a gold certificate. The two songs dominated streams and playlists across the world during the summer of 2015.

## What's Next?

Since releasing those two incredible singles, Kygo has released other material such as “Here for you” featuring Ella Henderson. Most recently releasing “Stay”. Following these releases and having a huge 2015, only two months ago was he recognised for being the fastest artist to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify. A few weeks ago he posted on social media a picture with his team showing a board that he had sold 7 million singles last year a long with over 1 billion streams which emphasises upon how big it was, I can assure that 2016 will not be any different with his much anticipated album is set to be released very soon.
