/**
 * If you have set `$responsive` to ‘true’ in `_vars.scss` then you now have
 * access to these classes. You can define at which breakpoint you’d like an
 * element to be a certain size, e.g.:
 *
 * `<div class="g  one-quarter  lap-one-half  palm-one-whole"> ... </div>`
 *
 * This would create a `div` that, at ‘desktop’ sizes, takes up a quarter of the
 * horizontal space, a half of that space at ‘tablet’ sizes, and goes full width
 * at ‘mobile’ sizes.
